**Vulnerabilities found**

Vulnerability 1: SQL injection 
Risk level: High URL affected: http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=%
27%28 
 
	Parameter: q (URL query string) 	 
WASC ID: 19 
 
Evidence: 
> SQL error received from backend: 
  "stack": "Error: SQLITE_ERROR: near \"(\": syntax error"        Description: 
SQL injection is a critical vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries via unsanitized input fields. In this case, the parameter ‘q’ in the search endpoint is not properly filtered, allowing for SQL syntax manipulation. ZAP detected this via malformed input  and observed database error messages, confirming backend query exposure.
  
 
Impact: 
➢	Can expose or modify sensitive data  
➢	May allow full database access as per query construction 
➢	May lead to data breaches, DoS, or privilege escalation 
Recommendations: 
➢	Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all data base access 
➢	Implement input sanitization and validation for query parameters 
➢	Avoid direct injection of user input into SQL queries 

Vulnerability 2: Private IP disclosure 
  Risk level: Medium URL affected: 
http://localhost:3000/rest/admin/applicationconfiguration 
Parameter: None 
WASC ID: 13 (Information leakage) 
 
Evidence: 
The HTTP response contains internal IP addresses visible to user: 
   http://127.0.0.1:4200,   http://192.168.89.100:3000 
 
Description: 
The application leaks internal IP addresses in its response body. These addresses should not be shown to external users, as they can reveal internal network architecture and may assist attackers in planning future intrusions. 
 
Impact: 
➢	Internal targeting: Internal systems could be targeted directly 
➢	Information leakage: Even if low-impact on its own, it shows improper sanitization of data Recommendations: 
➢	Sanitize server responses to remove internal IPs before sending data to the client 
➢	Audit all endpoints for unintentional disclosure of internal infra 
  
 
Vulnerability 3: Vulnerable JSON library(jQuery) 
 
Risk level : Medium URL affected: 
http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jq uery.min.js 
Parameter: None 
WASC ID: 20 
CWE ID: 937 
 
Evidence: 
  Library detected: jquery 2.4.1  
  The identified library appears to be vulnerable 
 
Description: 
The application is using an outdated version of jQuery, which is known to have security vulnerabilities. Attackers may exploit known weaknesses such as XSS injection vectors, Prototype pollution, Bypass for security controls  
 
Impact: 
  An attacker could leverage known weaknesses in the outdated library to conduct malicious attacks     Increase in attack surface unnecessarily, even though patched versions are available 
 
Recommendation: 
➢	Upgrade to latest version 
➢	Regularly audit all third-party libraries for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP dependencycheck
