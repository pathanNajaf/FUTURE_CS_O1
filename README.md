Documentation of everything I am doing to upskill myself as a security professional

This repo is my record of the task 1 I was given during my internship at Future Interns

Aim:- To conduct a security on an intentionally vulnerable sample web application to find and document weaknesses in the application

Sample website:- OWASP juice shop

Tool used for identifying flaws:- OWASP ZAP

About Juice Shop:-
OWASP Juice Shop is a deliberately vulnerable online juice store used to learn and practice web security by finding and exploiting real-world vulnerabilities in a safe environment.

About OWASP ZAP:-
OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a free, open-source security tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications by intercepting, scanning, and testing their traffic.

What I did:-

Found three intentionally left vulnerabilities in the OWASP Juice shop using OWASP ZAP

The three vulnerabilities are as follow:-
1. SQL injection
2. Private IP disclosure
3. Vulnerable JSON library
